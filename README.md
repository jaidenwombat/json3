# json4

A tiny, fast, standard conformant JSON parser.

This was written for my own personal use, but you can use it if you want I guess.

It has no dependencies other than the C standard library, so you should just be able to drop it into a project and use it.

It's currently only capable of parsing JSON text from a string into an iterable tree structure, but someday it might be able to do more.

I tried very hard to make it as conformant as possible to the [RFC 8259 standard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259).

Requires at least C99.

## How use?

Take a look for yourself:

```c
#include <string.h>
#include <stdio.h>

#include "json4.h"

int main() {
	char const *text = "{\"name\": \"Sock\", \"species\": \"cat\", \"age\": 100,\
\"likes to pee on carpet\": true, \"friends\": [\"the sun\", \"the moon\", \"the stars\"]}";
  
	Json *json = json_parse(text, strlen(text));
	// Alternatively you can use `json_parse_file(char const *path)`
	if (json == NULL) {
		fputs("malloc failed (or file stream couldn't be opened if `json_parse_file` was used)", stderr);
		return 1;
	}
	if (json_is_error(json)) {
		fprintf(stderr, "JSON error on line %i: %s\n", (int)json->error->line, json->error->message);
		return 1;
	}
	
	char const *name;
	char const *species;
	double age;
	bool likes_to_pee_on_carpet; // <stdbool.h> is included by "json4.h" if you're not using c++
	char const *friends[3];
	
	for (
		JsonObjectEntry *object_entry = json->object->first;
		object_entry != NULL;
		object_entry = object_entry->next
	) {
		char const *key = object_entry->key;
		if (strcmp(key, "name") == 0)
			name = object_entry->value->string->text;
		else if (strcmp(key, "species") == 0)
			species = object_entry->value->string->text;
		else if (strcmp(key, "age") == 0)
			age = object_entry->value->number;
		else if (strcmp(key, "likes to pee on carpet") == 0)
			likes_to_pee_on_carpet = object_entry->value->boolean;
		else if (strcmp(key, "friends") == 0) {
			int friend_index = 0;
			for (
				JsonArrayEntry *array_entry = object_entry->value->array->first;
				array_entry != NULL;
				array_entry = array_entry->next
			) {
				friends[friend_index++] = array_entry->value->string->text;
			}
		}
	}
	
	printf("%s is a %s who is age %g and %s to pee on the carpet.\n", name, species, age, likes_to_pee_on_carpet ? "likes" : "does not like");
	printf("%s is friends with %s, %s, and %s.\n", name, friends[0], friends[1], friends[2]);
	
	free(json);
}
```
## More details

To avoid it being super slow, I tried to minimise the number of expensive memory allocations the parser needs to make while running.

At the beginning of parsing, it estimates how much space it will need to store all the parsed data by counting the number of commas, colons, opening square and curly brackets, and quoted characters in the input text. Then it allocates a buffer of that size with `malloc` and uses a bump allocation system to allocate within that during parsing. The only other call to `malloc` it makes is one to store its own copy of the input text, which it does to create 16 bytes of cushion at the end to avoid peeking into uninitialised memory while it runs.

But what is the format of the data generated by the parser? you might ask.

JSON values are stored in the `Json` data structure containing an enum value representing the kind of value it is and a union between all the kinds of values it could be. If the value is a string, an array, or an object, the `Json` data structure will contain a pointer to a separate data structure representing that type. Arrays and objects are both stored as singly linked lists.
